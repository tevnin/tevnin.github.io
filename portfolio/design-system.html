        <p>As Product Design Director at Glassdoor, I led the delivery of component design & development for Glassdoor's Design System as the company launched a <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/welcome-to-the-new-glassdoor/" target="_blank">product-wide rebrand</a>. I developed and implemented a governance model across the organization, including streamlining adoption of and enabling contribution to the Design System by Product teams.</p>

        <h3>Figma Component Library</h3>
        <!-- <img src="../assets/images/structure.png" width="50%" height="50%" > -->
        <p>The Design System was a shared language among all designers and front-end engineers at Glassdoor. As designers were using Figma to craft their work output, there we built a robust libary of usable and scalable components and documentation. A few examples of component documentation are below.</p>

        <h3>Governance</h3>
        <!-- <img src="../assets/images/structure.png" width="50%" height="50%" > -->
        <p>The ultimate goal of the Design System was to enable designers and engineers across the company to be more efficient in delivering modern design, accessibility, security, performance and SEO, so that the product teams can do what they do best: ship new features. The Governance Model helped Product teams to understand how to adopt the system, identifying gaps or enhancements to recommend, and notify the DS team in a timely manner through the proper channel that they needed support, so that they could deliver toward their product requirements.</p>

        <h3>System Structure & Org Education</h3>
        <!-- <img src="../assets/images/structure.png" width="50%" height="50%" > -->
        <p>It was important to educating partners and executives about the structure of the Design System, so that they could understand how this effort would help to accelarate design and development. Atomic structure, content density, and screen-size breakpoints translated into scalable building blocks of key content types, like Jobs.</p>
