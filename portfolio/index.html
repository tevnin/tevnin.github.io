        </div>
        <p>Working with a cross functional team, I led Design strategy, user research, ideation, and prototyping for an effort to clarify Glassdoorâ€™s approach to winning in the Employee Experience space. The project consisted of 3 phases:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Discovery - Defining the user, core insight, and need space. Establishing conviction for why Glassdoor has an advantage in solving for this need. Validating the business case.</li>
                <li>Concept - Defining & vetting a new product to pursue.</li>
                <li>Development - Alpha & Beta testing. Go to market planning.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>We worked with an Executive steering committee throughout the project to share progress and to make decisions about next steps.</p>
