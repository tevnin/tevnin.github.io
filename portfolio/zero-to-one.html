        <p>Working with a cross functional team, I led Design strategy, user research, ideation, and prototyping for an effort to clarify Glassdoor&apos;s approach to winning in a nascent product space, Employee Experience. The project consisted of 3 phases:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Discovery - Defining the user, core insight, and need space. Establishing conviction for why Glassdoor has an advantage in solving for this need. Validating the business case.</li>
                <li>Concept - Defining & vetting a new product to pursue.</li>
                <li>Development - Alpha & Beta testing. Go to market planning.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>We worked with an Executive steering committee throughout the project to share progress and to make decisions about next steps.</p>
        <div class="impact">
            <h3>So what?</h3>
            <p>Our final pitch was delivered to Executive Leadership in August 2021. Later that month, <b>it was announced internally that Glassdoor would be acquiring Fishbowl, a professional social network which solved for many of the unmet needs & advantages we identified in this project.</b></p>

        <h3>Discovery Phase</h3>
        <!-- <img src="../assets/images/structure.png" width="50%" height="50%" > -->
        <p>We entered the discovery phase with the goal of building conviction around a core unaddressed need in the Employee Experience market that connected to Glassdoor&apos;s unique advantage. We started with identifying customer needs, through in depth interviews and market research; synthesized data into personas, key focus areas, and advantage hypotheses; and ended with ideation of potential solutions. This plan evolved over time as we learned more about the domain and identified gaps in our knowledge or opportunities for more insights.</p>

        <h3>Concept Phase</h3>
        <!-- <img src="../assets/images/structure.png" width="50%" height="50%" > -->
        <p>The goal of the concept phase was to create hypotheses and product concepts to test with target users in order to create a product blueprint of prioritized use cases, journey maps, and features. My primary role was building and iterating on prototypes for concept tests for various use cases.</p>
        <p>I crafted a series of proof of concept views for B2B users. Wireframes were used to collect feedback amongst the team and internal stakeholders. Higher fidelity mockups were then created to share in concept testing sessions with potential users.</p>
        <div class="img-group">

        </div>

        <p>In addition to B2B concepts, I designed proof of concept prototoypes to test with potential B2C users. Below is one such prototype we used in concept testing. You can also watch a video walkthrough of the prototype <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14ga9fcmIJ0DoKj-0IIXfttrtnLOIWO3T/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <h3>So what?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>By the end of the concept phase, we saw very strong traction of our product concept with Employee users. The value proposition of creating a safe space to engage openly and transparently with your team resonated strongly.</li>
            <li>Department leader users were interested in and open to the product concept if we could deliver the team engagement and team solutions they were already lacking.</li>
            <li>After considering several approaches, we believed our way-in was to engage employees through an internal surface, but relied on an external strategy to quickly earn the attention and support of department leaders, who could help us solve our cold-start challenge by encouraging employees to participate.</li>
            <li>Our next planned step was to collaborate with various product and cross-functional teams to create a roadmap for both development and go-to-market.</li>
